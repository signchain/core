Signchain Development Roadmap :rocket:
===


:::info
A highlevel development roadmap created after the EthOnline hackathon

Roadmap comprises of these features:
- User profiles
- Verifiable credintials
- Secure document exchange
- Tamperproof and varifiable signature proofs
---
We have classified our development roadmap into categories:

- :bust_in_silhouette: **Identity :**
    > Technologies : Ceramic IDX, Textile ThreadDB

- :file_folder: **Data storage :**
    > Technologies : Ceramic IDX, Textile ThreadDB

- :memo: **Signature and encryption standards**
    > Technologies : Ethereum, Textile, Ceramic wallets

- :art: **UI/UX :**
    > Frameworks: Ant design/ Semantic UI

:bust_in_silhouette: Identity
---
Integration of SSI based solutions
> Technologies : Ceramic IDX, Textile ThreadDB
    
- [ ] Authenticating user though Metamask + 3ID connect for signing and encryption
- [x] User profile creation on IDX
- [ ] Attaching the signable document to the profile 
- [ ] Getting a credential issues
- [ ] Presenting the credential whenever needed

:file_folder: Data storage
---
Integration of decentralized storage solutions with privacy
> Technologies : Textile ThreadDB, Textile Buckets
    
- [x] Storing the encrypted docs using decentralized storage services
- [ ] Move the key exchange mechanism from contract to Textile ThreadDB
- [ ] Store the user and document metadata on ThreadDB until pinned to IDX profile

:memo: Signature and encryption standards
---
Integration of wallets for key generation
> Technologies : Ethereum, Textile, Ceramic wallets
    
- [ ] Supporting multiple electronic signature formats
- [ ] Digital signature and encryption specifications

:art: UI/ UX
---
Integration of wallets for key generation
> Frameworks: Ant design/ Semantic UI
    
- [ ] Update the existing components with new inspirations
- [ ] Make the code base lightweight
